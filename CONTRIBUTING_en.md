# How to contribute to Pilas Bloques

Thanks for your support! :heart:. If you hadn't done it yet, please read the [project README](https://github.com/Program-AR/pilas-bloques/blob/develop/README_en.md). There you'll find our app's main goals and instructions to get started with the development environment.
In Pilas Bloques we work using Pull Requests and feature branches. So if you want to contribute, fork the project, make your changes in a branch, and make a Pull Request to the original repo.
You can check the [first good issues](https://github.com/Program-AR/pilas-bloques/labels/good%20first%20issue) or also the [Pilas Bloques Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/Program-AR/projects) for hints on what is there to do.

## Issues

If you found a bug and you want to report it, or if you have an idea for a feature for Pilas Bloques, [create an issue describing it](https://github.com/Program-AR/pilas-bloques/issues/new).

## Pull Requests

* Link the solved issue in your PR description using `Fixes #<issue number>`.
* If you make visual changes, you are encouraged to include a screen capture showing the change.
* Include unit or integration tests for each feature or fix you make.
* Every test in the app should pass.
* Todo el nuevo codigo tiene que estar en ingles. El objetivo a futuro es que todo Pilas Bloques esté traducido al inglés. Es por ello que el código introducido con cada Pull Request debe estar en inglés. Además, si el código modifica bastante de un componente, se espera que se aproveche el PR para hacer la traducción del mismo.

Example of a good PR: https://github.com/Program-AR/pilas-bloques/pull/878

* If you want to start the translation to a language that Pilas Bloques doesn't support yet, you can do so by creating a translation file in the [translations folder](https://github.com/Program-AR/pilas-bloques/tree/develop/translations) and making a pull request with your proposed translation.

## About the language

Pilas Bloques has a user and developer community that are mainly spanish-speakers. That's why the documentation and PRs are mainly written in **spanish**, as well as _the code_.

However, in order to broaden these communities we are beggining to **accept english as a secondary language for our issues and discussions** and we already have our first english docs. 

Furthermore we have a very ambitious goal: **we're starting to translate app code to english**. That's why:

* Every newly added code in the pull request should be written in English. :gb: 
* Pilas Bloques team will eagerly help you with any issues with the existing or new code. :+1: 
* If a PR does extensive changes to a component, you are encouraged to translate the entire component to English. :mechanical_arm:
